## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Music generation via MusicFX
The system SHALL allow users to submit a text prompt and receive 1–2 audio clips (~30s) generated by the MusicFX DEFAULT model without storing secrets server-side.

#### Scenario: Generate two clips successfully
- **WHEN** user supplies a valid prompt and valid cookie
- **AND** selects generationCount = 2, loop = false, soundLengthSeconds = 30
- **THEN** the system sends POST `https://aisandbox-pa.googleapis.com/v1:soundDemo` with Authorization Bearer token from cookie
- **AND** the system receives 2 audio clips with model/duration metadata and shows Play/Download buttons for each

#### Scenario: Missing cookie blocked
- **WHEN** GOOGLE_COOKIE is absent in context
- **THEN** the system does not call MusicFX
- **AND** shows guidance to enter the cookie

#### Scenario: API timeout/429 surfaced
- **WHEN** MusicFX responds 429 or exceeds 60s
- **THEN** the system shows a clear error and suggests retry, without freezing UI
